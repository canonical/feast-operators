summary: Feast UI charm.

description: |
  Feast UI charm provides the user interface for interacting with Feast,
  the feature store for machine learning.

  The charm:
  1. Serves a web-based interface for managing and inspecting Feast projects.
  2. Integrates with the Feast Integrator charm to receive configuration details.
  3. Supports ingress integration to expose the UI through a gateway in a Kubeflow environment.

  Feast UI is a critical component of the Feast bundle, enabling users to
  visualize and interact with their feature store setups.
