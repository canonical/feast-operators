Charmed Feast documentation
===========================

Charmed Feast is a fully managed, Charmed Operator-based deployment of the Feast feature store, built for seamless integration with Charmed Kubeflow.

It simplifies the deployment and life cycle management of Feast components using Juju, and connects directly to Kubeflow Notebooks, enabling feature registration and retrieval from a familiar ML environment.

Charmed Feast helps data scientists and MLOps engineers bridge the gap between data engineering and model deployment, by streamlining feature management across training and inference workflows.

This solution is ideal for teams using Charmed Kubeflow that need a robust, production-ready feature store with PostgreSQL backing both online and offline retrieval use cases.
