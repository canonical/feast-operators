  Feast Integrator charm is the center of the Feast bundle

  The charm:
  1. Owns the Feast store configuration file and sends it to
  resource-dispatcher to apply it to user namespaces.

  2. Integrates with the registry, offline store, and online store
  database charms to get the database configurations and use
  them to render the Feast configuration file. 

  3. Integrates with the Feast UI charm and sends it the store 
  configuration data.

  Feast Integrator is essential to integrate Feast with Postgresql
  charms and the Kubeflow bundle.
